Somewehre between DMstack w_2018_39 and w_2019_19, there was a modifcation
to the repo structure, specifically for coadds.  This prevents Run1.2 data from
being handled correctly by later versions of the DMstack resulting in an error.
This can be fixed by rearranging the Run1.2 data using symlinks to provide the
directory structure current versions of the DMstack expect.

This directory contains scripts to do just that.
